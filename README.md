# IoT Simulator

## Background 

This module is used to demonstrate the power of [EnMasse](https://enmasse.io/), a streamlined and easy to use messaging infrastructure that can be deployed on a custom Kubernetes instance or openshift cluster. This system becomes extremely useful for the Edge computing / IOT workload where many types of devices and communication protocols must be supported while maintaining the scalabilty and autonomy provided by modern Container orchestration platforms. 

This example specifically demonstrates the power of the newer IOT features provided by EnMasse and powered by Ecipse hono. With these addons EnMasse will give the user the ability to build scalable and resilient messaging architectures connecting the edge to the cloud. 

The diagram shown below gives a good overview of the end to end system

## The setup 

This demostration is split up into 4 major modules that are deployed in 4 different pods during use 

1. Simulator
    * Manages the Producer and Consumer
2. Producer 
    * Generates arbitrary MQTT or HTTP telemetry messages that are sent to EnMasse's IoT protocol adapter (Eclipse Hono)
3. Consumer 
    * Consumes the Telemetry messages produced by the Enmasse instance 
4. Web Console
    * Displays information about the data exchange between producer and consumer


# Deploy the IoT simulator

This Demo can be deployed on either a **remote** or **local** OpenShift instance 

## Remotely 

See this [link](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/welcome/index.html) for more information on creating a remotely hosted openshift instance 

## Locally: CodeReadyContainers(CRC)

If using CRC, first create a new machine using the following command:

    crc start

## Prepare your OpenShift cluster

1. Log in as admin
2. Make new project titled "enmasse-infra" 
    
       oc new-project enmasse-infra

## Getting EnMasse

There are two ways to Deploy enmasse to your cluster, either **manually** or via the provided [**Enmasse operator**](https://operatorhub.io/operator/enmasse)

Regardless please download and install the EnMasse tarball since we do some setup with these via the command line

Download EnMasse:

    curl -sL https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/releases/download/0.30.2/enmasse-0.30.2.tgz -o enmasse.tar.gz

Unpack the archive:

    mkdir enmasse
    cd enmasse
    tar --strip-components=1 -xzf ../enmasse.tar.gz
    cd ..

### Operator

Using Openshift's web console navagate to the "Operatorhub" tab and search for "enmasse" 

![step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astoycos/iot-simulator-example/master/doc/Screenshot%20from%202020-01-27%2015-04-07.jpg)

Click "install" 

![step2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astoycos/iot-simulator-example/master/doc/Screenshot%20from%202020-01-27%2015-07-39.jpg)

Choose to "install in a specific namespace" and make sure the project enmasse-infra is selected 

![step3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astoycos/iot-simulator-example/master/doc/Screenshot%20from%202020-01-27%2015-08-15.jpg)

### Manually

Make sure you are on the correct openshift project 

    $ oc project enmasse-infra
    Now using project "enmasse-infra" on server "https://api.my-cluster.my-domain:6443".`

Install the bundle  

    oc apply -f enmasse/install/bundles/enmasse`
 

## Configuring EnMasse
   
    oc apply -f enmasse/install/preview-bundles/iot
    oc apply -f enmasse/install/components/example-authservices/standard-authservice.yaml
    oc apply -f enmasse/install/components/example-roles
    oc apply -f enmasse/install/components/example-plans

## Enable EnMasse's IoT feature

Enable the feature:

    oc apply -f deploy/010-Infrastructure

And wait for the configuration to be ready:

    oc get iotconfig

The output should show `Ready` in the column `PHASE`:

    NAME      PHASE
    default   Ready

## Create a new IoT project

Create the new project:

    oc new-project myapp
    oc apply -f deploy/020-Project

And wait for the project to be ready (This will normally take a few minutes):

    oc get iotproject

The output should show `Ready` in the column `PHASE`:

    NAME   IOT TENANT   DOWNSTREAM HOST                          DOWNSTREAM PORT   TLS    PHASE
    iot    myapp.iot    messaging-vv2rt4cho5.enmasse-infra.svc   5671              true   Ready

## Deploy the simulator

    oc new-project iot-simulator
    oc apply -f deploy/030-SimulatorOperator

## Create a new simulator instance

Get the necessary information:

    export MESSAGING_HOST=$(oc -n myapp get addressspace iot -o 'jsonpath={ .status.endpointStatuses[?(@.name=="messaging")].serviceHost }')
    export CA_CERT=$(oc -n myapp get addressspace iot -o 'jsonpath={ .status.caCert }')
    export MGMT_TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)

And then apply the configuration and deploy simulator module to cluster:

    cat deploy/040-Simulator/010-Simulator.yaml.in | envsubst | oc apply -f -

**Note:** When using `$(oc whoami -t)`, you will use the current user's token for authenticating. The user of this
          token must have permissions to access the `IoTProject` created earlier on. As this also is the token of
          a user, the token will expire. Normally after 24h of logging in the user. Alternatively you can create a
          service account, get that token, and use it instead.

## Deploy the Producer and Consumer modules

    oc apply -f deploy/050-Workload
    
## See Results 

Wait until the above steps are complete (i.e the simulator, producer, consumer, and web-console pods are running) 

If everything is working correctly you should be able to open the web console at 
   
    iot-simulator-console-iot-simulator.apps.<your cluster>
